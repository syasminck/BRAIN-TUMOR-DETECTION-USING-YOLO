## BRAIN TUMOR DETECTION USING YOLO

The early detection and precise diagnosis of many disorders, including brain tumors, are greatly aided by medical imaging. In order to improve the detection and segmentation of brain tumors in medical images, this project will make use of cutting-edge computer vision algorithms. 

The 77 brain scans in the dataset used in this study represent a wide variety of tumor sizes and types.
The dataset contains a total of 77 brain images for training, testing and validating the model. The proposed approach uses the YOLO algorithm, which is well renowned for its quick and accurate object detection, to find tumors in medical images. The annotated dataset will be used to train the algorithm, which will enable it to learn various tumor characteristics and locations.


The project uses the SAM algorithm, an advanced segmentation approach, to precisely define tumor boundaries after tumor's have been found. The Segment Anything Model offers a powerful and versatile solution for object segmentation in images.


In order to improve patient outcomes and enable wise clinical decision-making, the proposed project aims to address the significant difficulties in early tumor identification and accurate segmentation.We aim to detect Brain Tumors and segmentation of detected brain tumors using medical images.Our goal is to train a deep learning model which focuses on using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm for tumor diagnosis.
